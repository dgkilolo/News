News is an application that allows users to choose from a very wide variety of new sources and once they have selected a news source they can see the top articles being shown by that source. The user can also click on a particular article if they would like to read the full article from the main page of the news source. The News application only displays the headline and other important information that the user might be intrested in.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Users are greeeted by the landing page which displays a wide variety of news sources.
The user can then click on their preferred news source and see articles from that source.
